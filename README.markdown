# dadbod.vim

Dadbod is a Vim plugin for interacting with databases.  It's a more modern
take on [dbext.vim][], improving on it on the following ways:

* Connections are specified with a single URL, rather than prompting you for
  14 separate variables
* All interaction is through invoking `:DB`, not 53 different commands and 35
  different maps (omitting many of the more esoteric features, of course)
* Supports a modern array of backends, including NoSQL databases:
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
  - Oracle
  - PostgreSQL
  - Presto
  - Redis
  - SQL Server
  - SQLite
  - Your own easily implemented adapter
* Easily configurable based on a project directory (as seen in [rails.vim][],
  for example), rather than just globally or in a per-file modeline
* For those that just can't live without some piece of dbext functionality,
  the option `g:dadbod_manage_dbext` is provided to force dbext to use
  Dadbod's default database.

## Usage

The `:DB` command has a few different usages.  All forms accept a URL as the
first parameter, which can be omitted if a default is configured or provided
by a plugin.

Omit further arguments to spawn an interactive console (like `psql` or
`redis-cli`).

    :DB postgresql:///foobar
    :DB redis:

If additional arguments are provided, they are interpreted as a query string
to pass to the database.  Results are displayed in a preview window.

    :DB sqlite:myfile.sqlite3 select count(*) from widgets
    :DB redis:/// CLIENT LIST

Give a range to run part or all of the current buffer as a query.

    :%DB mysql://root@localhost/bazquux

Use `<` to pass in a filename.

    :DB mongodb:///test < big_query.js

There's also a special assignment syntax for saving a URL to a Vim variable
for later use.

    :DB g:prod = postgres://user:pass@db.example.com/production_database
    :DB g:prod drop table users

A few additional URL like formats are accepted for interop:

* `:DB jdbc:sqlserver://...`
* `:DB dbext:profile=profile_name`
* `:DB dbext:type=PGSQL:host=...`
* `:DB $DATABASE_URL` (with optional [dotenv.vim][] support)

Plugins can provide their own URL handlers as well.  For example,
[heroku.vim][] provides support for `heroku:appname` style URLs.
