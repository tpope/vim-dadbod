USAGE                                           *dadbod* *:DB*

:DB [url]               Start an interactive database console.  Uses
                        dispatch.vim's |:Start| if available.

:DB [url] {cmd}         Run {cmd} on the selected database and show the
                        results in a preview window.

:{range}DB [url]        Run the lines referenced by {range} on the selected
                        database and show the results in a preview window.

:DB [url] < {file}      Run the given {file} on the selected database and show
                        the results in a preview window.

:DB {var} = {url}       Assign the canonicalization of {url} to a |g:|, |w:|,
                        |t:|, |b:|, or environment variable.

:DB [url] :{command}    Run the Vim command {command} with the given URL set
                        as the default.  This is mainly useful with
                        |g:dadbod_manage_dbext|.

In the preview window, you can press "R" to rerun, "r" to interactively rerun,
or "q" to close the window.

URLS                                            *dadbod-urls*

URLs are adapter specific but generally take one of two formats:
>
    adapter://[user[:password]@][host][:port]/[database]
    adapter:[database]

A complete reference is below under |dadbod-adapters|, but a few examples should
mostly get the point across:
>
    postgresql://postgres:secret@remote-host/test
    mysql://root@localhost/test
    sqlite:db.sqlite3
    mongodb:///admin
    redis:///
<
Additionally, one can give:

* A Vim variable (e.g., g:foo, w:bar, t:baz, b:quux) or environment variable
  (e.g., $DATABASE_URL) containing a URL.
* File name of a supported database file (e.g. ~/db.sqlite3). Relative paths
  must start with "./", and spaces must be %20 URL encoded (NOT backslash
  escaped).

VARIABLES                                       *dadbod-variables*

If a |w:|, |t:|, |b:|, |g:|, or $ENVIRONMENT variable is given as a URL, its
value will be used.  Additionally, if no URL is given, the first of w:db,
t:db, b:db, $DATABASE_URL, and g:db will be used.  Suggested uses:

* w:db is best set interactively.
* b:db is most useful when set from an |autocommand|.
* g:db and other globals can be set in your |vimrc| or other startup file.
* $DATABASE_URL and other environment variables are easy to set externally.

Set a variable with |:let|, or use |:DB| to normalize the URL first:
>
    :DB w:db = adapter://...

ADAPTERS                                        *dadbod-adapters*

                                                *dadbod-dbext*
dbext ~
>
    dbext:type=<type>[:<attr>=<value>][...]
    dbext:profile=<profile>[...]
<
For supported adapters, dbext modelines and profiles can be used directly.

                                                *dadbod-impala*
Impala ~
>
    impala://[<host>[:<port>]]/[<database>]

                                                *dadbod-mongodb*
MongoDB ~
>
    mongodb://[<user>[:<password>]@][<host>[:<port>]]/[<database>][?ssl=true]
    mongodb:[<database>]
<
                                                *dadbod-mysql*
MySQL ~
>
    mysql://[<user>[:<password>]@][<host>[:<port>]]/[database]
    mysql://[<user>[:<password>]@][<%2Fsocket%2Fpath>]/[<database>]
    mysql:///[<database>]?login-path=<login-path>
    mysql:[<database>]
<
                                                *dadbod-oracle*
Oracle ~
>
    oracle://[<user>[:<password>]@][<host>][:<port>]/[<database>]
    oracle:<user>/<password>@[//]<host>[:<port>]/<database>
<
                                                *dadbod-osquery*
osquery ~
>
    osquery:relative/path
    osquery:/absolute/path
    osquery:C:/windows/path
    osquery:///relative/or/absolute/path
<
An empty path portion uses an in-memory database, which is how osquery is
typically invoked.

                                                *dadbod-postgresql*
PostgreSQL ~
>
    postgresql://[<user>[:<password>]@][<host>[:<port>]]/[<database>]
    postgresql://[<user>[:<password>]@][<%2Fsocket%2Fpath>]/[<database>]
    postgresql:[<database>]
<
For interop, postgres:// URLs are also accepted.

                                                *dadbod-presto*
Presto ~
>
    presto://[<host>[:<port>]]/[<catalog>[/<schema>]]
<
                                                *dadbod-redis*
Redis ~
>
    redis://[[unused[:<password>]@]<host>]/[<database-number>]
    redis:[<database-number>]
<
Redis doesn't have a username, so use a dummy one in the URL if a password is
required.

                                                *dadbod-sqlserver*
SQL Server ~
>
    sqlserver://[<user>[:<password>]@][<host>][:<port>]/[<database>]
    sqlserver://[<host>[:<port>]][;user=<user>][;...]
<
If the user and password are omitted, a trusted connection is used.

                                                *dadbod-sqlite*
SQLite ~
>
    sqlite:relative/path
    sqlite:/absolute/path
    sqlite:C:/windows/path
    sqlite:///relative/or/absolute/path
<
In the wild, uses of sqlite:///path vary on whether the path is relative or
absolute, so both are checked.  The preferred form is sqlite:path, which
avoids this ambiguity.

An empty path portion uses an in-memory database, which is occasionally useful
for an interactive invocation.

DBEXT MANAGEMENT                                *g:dadbod_manage_dbext*

If you like Dadbod's configuration but need some of dbext's functionality, set
the following variable to enable an experimental mode where dbext's
configuration always mirrors Dadbod's default.
>
  let g:dadbod_manage_dbext = 1
